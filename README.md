# help

  Hi, I just need a place to put all the things I'm gonna use later on for the Help page. <br />
  I'm also using this as an opportunity to figure out how Github works.
  
    Most of these images are only going to be used after I ask the people who made them for direct permission.
<br />
  If I don't ask for direct permission, I'm going to be embedding them.
